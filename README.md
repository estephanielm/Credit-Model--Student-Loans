In this project, we aim to predict the credit rating of student loans using four distinct classification models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest. To achieve this, a dataset obtained from a CSV file has been utilized, which includes various characteristics related to the loans and a target column named credit_ranking, indicating the credit rating (high, medium, and low risk). The following code implements the data preparation, model training, and performance evaluation.
